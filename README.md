# Viewing Data ( /get Command )
The /get command enables users to retrieve registered information from the Google Sheets and display it in a paginated format within Discord. This command provides an easy way for users to view the stored data without accessing the Google Sheets directly.

``` /get ```

Executing this command will display the stored information in a paginated format, making it easy for users to navigate through the data.
